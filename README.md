# Reinforcement Learning Coursework Projects

This repository contains a collection of reinforcement learning assignments that I completed as part of my university coursework in Fall 2024.

## Overview
The mini projects include implementations and experiments related to the following topics:
- N-armed bandit problems  
- Dynamic programming  
- Policy iteration  
- Value iteration  
- Monte Carlo methods  

## Structure
Each notebook is a self-contained assignment and includes:
- A description of the problem in the README file and the notebook  
- The implemented method using Python  
- Experiments and results  
- Brief discussion and reflections  

## Notes
These projects were completed as part of academic coursework and are intended to demonstrate my practical experience with reinforcement learning concepts.
